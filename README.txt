The FOTE application will automatically drop and repopulate the database, 
so there is no need to run any pre-programs.

FOTE can be launched via NetBeans by running FOTE.java

Once launched, the login dialog will allow existing users to login,
or new users can create an account. 
The prepopulated accounts are:
            USERNAME                            PASSWORD
	admin   			-	admin
	robert.nisco1@marist.edu	-	password123
	jason.parraga1@marist.edu	-	password123
	Evan.VanDam1@marist.edu         -	password123

New users can be created by clicking the button and filling out the form,
and can then return to the login screen using the same information.
Please note that the usernames and passwords are case-sensitive.
	
Once logged in, the user can create and view any proposals and suggestions,
but only update or delete if they are the owner.
    1. Suggestions and proposals can be created by clicking the "+" button
       located on the top-right of the respective table and completing the form.
    2. These can be retrieved simply by left-clicking the table row, which will 
       launch a new dialog that displays all of the information for the 
       suggestion or proposal.
    3. To update an entry that you own, click the "edit" button found in the 
       group on the bottom-right of the window, and perform the updates in 
       the new form and save changes.		
    4. To delete an entry that you own, click the "delete" button found next to 
       the "edit" button.
