## How to Run
* The FOTE application will automatically drop and repopulate the database, so there is no need to run any pre-programs.
* FOTE can be launched via NetBeans by running FOTE.java
* Once launched, the login dialog will allow existing users to login, or new users can create an account.

## Prepopulated accounts
|          USERNAME           |   PASSWORD   |
| --------------------------- |:------------:|
| admin     		              | admin        |
| robert.nisco1 @ marist.edu	| password123  |
| json.parraga1 @ marist.edu	|	password123  |
| Evan.VanDam1 @ marist.edu   |	password123  |
* Remove spaces in usernames

## Creating a new user
* New users can be created by clicking the button and filling out the form, and can then return to the login screen using the same information.
* Please note that the usernames and passwords are case-sensitive.

## Using the application
1. Once logged in, the user can create and view any proposals and suggestions, but only update or delete if they are the owner.
2. Suggestions and proposals can be created by clicking the "+" button located on the top-right of the respective table and completing the form.
3. These can be retrieved simply by left-clicking the table row, which will launch a new dialog that displays all of the information for the suggestion or proposal.
4. To update an entry that you own, click the "edit" button found in the group on the bottom-right of the window, and perform the updates in the new form and save changes.
5. To delete an entry that you own, click the "delete" button found next to the "edit" button.
